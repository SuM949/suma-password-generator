# suma-password-generator
 Description  
 
 .Create an application that generates a random password based
  on user-selected criteria. This app will run in the browser 
  and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered
   by your JavaScript code.
 .The user will be prompted to choose from 
 the following password criteria:

  - Length (must be between 8 and 128 characters)

    - Character type:

    . Special characters
    . Numeric characters
    . Lowercase characters
    . Uppercase characters

   The application should validate user input and ensure that
   at least one character type is selected.

   Once all prompts are answered, 
  the user will be presented with a password matching the answered 
  prompts. Displaying the generated password in an alert 
  is acceptable, but attempt to write the password to the page 
   instead.


  HTML & CSS

 - in html code i did not required to change anything 
  but i preferred to change the un-semantic to semantic elements
  as part of what we did in the first homework,
  it is a thing that left on me from that homework.

 - in css i have changed the colors to the on i want.
